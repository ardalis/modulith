Modulith is a `dotnet new template` suite for Modular Monoliths. It streamlines the creation of new .Net solutions and
the addition of modules to existing ones.

But, what is a Modular Monolith? Glad you asked. It is a software architecture style to build maintainable applications
as a single unit, but in nicely separated modules (Modu-lith, pun intended 🙃).
More [about Modular Monoliths](#about-modular-monoliths).

# 🏁 Start here

#### Install by running:

```pwsh
dotnet new install Ardalis.Modulith
```

#### Create a new solution:

``` pwsh
dotnet new modulith -n eShop --with-module Payments 
```

`eShop` is your solution name, and `Payments` is the first module name (defaults to `FirstModule` if not specified).

#### Create a new module

``` pwsh
cd eShop
dotnet new modulith-proj --add-module Shipments --solution eShop
```

*⚠️ `cd` into the solution folder to add the module inside the solution.*

`Shipments` is the name of your new module. This will create a new module folder with the same three projects as
in `Users/`.

### Add a reference to the new module

Run:

``` pwsh
dotnet add eShop.Web/eShop.Web.csproj reference Shipment/eShop.Shipment/eShop.Shipment.csproj
```

# 🏛️ Solution directory structure

The previous command creates the following project structure:

- eShop
    - `Users/` 👈 Your first module
    - `eShop.Web/` 👈 Your entry point

Inside `Payments`, you will find the project folders:

- `eShop.Payments/` 👈 Your project code goes here
- `eShop.Payments.Contracts/` 👈 Public contracts other modules can depend on
- `eShop.Payments.Tests/` 👈 Your module tests

## Project dependencies

Since this is a Modular Monolith, there are a few rules that are enforced to guarantee the modularity:

- Every type in `eShop.Payments/` is internal
- This 👆 is enforced by an archUnit test in `eShop.Payments.Tests/`
- The only exception to the last two rules is the static class that configures the services for the
  module: `UsersModule...Extensions.cs`
- `.Contracts/` and `.Tets/` projects depend on `eShop.Payments/`. The opposite is not possible. This is by design.

\* *You can always change these rules after you have created the solution to suit your needs. But be mindful of why you
are changing the rules. For example, it is ok to add an additional public extensions class to configure the application
pipeline, while adding a public contract to `eShop.Payments/` is not. We have a project for those.*

## Adding a reference automatically to new modules

We support this, but the .Net SDK does not yet. There is an active PR
at [dotnet/sdk #40133](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/40133). Give it a vote if you'd like this feature:

⚠️ `cd` into the solution folder. I.e. `eShop/`, then run:

``` pwsh
dotnet new modulith-proj --ModuleName Shipments --existingProject eShop.Web/eShop.Web.csproj
```

Here `Shipments` is the name of your new module, and `eShop.Web/eShop.Web.csproj` is the path to your web entry project.
If you changed this, make sure you update it to the new path and that is relative to the solution folder.

# 📊 About Modular Monoliths

A Modular Monolithic app benefits from the simple deployment of a monolith and the separation of concerns that
microservices offer. While avoiding the complexities and maitainability issues they can introduce. When you are ready
and *if* you need it, you can split a module as a microservice. Best of both worlds 🌎

This is not a new concept. Martin Fowler [explains it here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html), and
Ardalis teaches
it [here](https://ardalis.com/introducing-modular-monoliths-goldilocks-architecture/#:~:text=A%20Modular%20Monolith%20is%20a%20software%20architecture%20that,that%20they%20are%20loosely%20coupled%20and%20highly%20cohesive.).

The templates in this project follow the solution structure as taught by [Ardalis](https://github.com/ardalis)
in [his course *Modular Monoliths in
DotNet*](https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-modular-monoliths-in-dotnet/).

# 🛃 Custom templates

No template fits all needs. If you weant to customize the template you can change it in the `working/content` directory
and running:

*⚠️ Make sure to uninstall the original template*

```pwsh
dotnet new install .
```

# 🗑️ Uninstall Modulith

```pwsh
dotnet new uninstall Ardalis.Modulith
```
